#### 3. Instructional Strategy
###### Name of Instructional Strategy  :    <u> Expository
###### Assessment Method: Formative Assessment.

<u> <b>Description: </b>  </u>
<br>
 Firstly the students will be explained off with each and every basics about the meta center, buoyancy, force of buoyancy, meta-centric height, equilibrium and non-equilibrium conditions, and the experiment. Then they will be explained about the procedure of the experiment, how to perform it. Then they will be asked to perform the experiment and find the value for angle of tilt for different values of applied weight and distance moved by the weight. After observing the values for angle of tilt they are supposed to calculate the meta-centric height using stated formula and verify their answers with pre-examined values or assumed standard values.
